    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nPurpose of Review: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is characterized by narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, resulting in decreased delivery of oxygen-rich blood to the myocardium of the heart. Although it is the most common manifestation of heart disease in the United States, the presenting symptoms of CAD vary widely and can easily be confused for other medical conditions, leading to difficulties in making the emergent diagnosis in an efficient manner. Fortunately, many advances have recently been made in the detection and diagnosis of CAD.\nRecent Findings: In this review, we will focus primarily upon recent innovations in noninvasive testing for obstructive CAD that may be expected to aid in the early diagnosis of this condition in the emergency department (ED). New technology is discussed, such as the CADSCor System, which uses highly sensitive acoustic readings to determine CAD risk. Preventative measures including noninvasive testing have also advanced. These are exemplified by the CaRi Heart System, which provides information about the likelihood of future cardiac events based upon estimation of coronary artery inflammation via computed tomography angiography.\nSummary: Recently developed technologies have the potential to decrease the burden of diagnostic tests involved in ruling out obstructive CAD when investigating a chief complaint of chest pain in the ED. This could be of benefit in clinical environments such as the ED, where prompt response is essential, and chest pain is a common complaint."
